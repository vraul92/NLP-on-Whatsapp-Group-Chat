# NLP-on-Whatsapp-Group-Chat
Applying NLP techniques on WhatsApp text to gain insights.

Extracted different entities from the text string using regular expressions and used data frames to handle the word tokens.
Performed EDA and asked some questions on the text data like 
 - top contributor to the group
 - busiest day after after the group's creation
 - which hours of the day are likely to be the busiest
 - most used words etc.
